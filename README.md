BC: The BpGC dataset, generated by finding the grape-berry annotations contained in each grape cluster, that is, covered by the mask of each grape cluster, and regard those berries and that cluster as an integral berry-per-grape-cluster annotation. 

WGISD: The ground truth WGISD generated with the method used in 'Decoupled Two-Stage Crowd Counting and Beyond'.
